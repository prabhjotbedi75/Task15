# Task15
Riemann Tasks 1) Who monitors the monitor ? Based on your understanding of the monitoring stack  - identify what could break monitoring  - will you be able to identify when component within monitoring stack goes down. If so how - how can you bring redundancy here  You can give a writeup ( use diagrams if you like to convey better )  2) Setup Riemann  - bring up toy riemann server whose job is to print/log events to stdout as events come.  -write a plugin/script in a language of your choice to monitor server load avg every min and send as event to riemann (Clients are available - https://riemann.io/clients.html)  - setup riemann-dashboard that displays riemann's index (in memory state of current events) and create a dashboard to see load event being sent (https://riemann.io/dashboard.html)  - See if you can combine Riemann server and Riemann dash installation as docker container.
